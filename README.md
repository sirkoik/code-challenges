# Code Challenges

This is an archive of code challenges that I have participated in on sites like Codewars.

I am in the process of uploading all of them. This is ongoing because I'm improving and reworking some of my older solutions to be more efficient.

## Navigating

The folder structure is Site -> Language -> Challenge Title.

Each challenge folder has:

1. A description file.
1. One or more solution files

The latest solution file is always `solution.(language suffix)`

## Descriptions

Description files have:

<ol>
  <li>Challenge title
  <li>Challenge description
  <li>Link to the challenge
  <li>Notes and solutions
    <ol>
      <li>My personal notes about the challenge, explaining how I solved it
      <li>All of my solutions to the challenge, past and current
    </ol>
  <li>Difficulty rank (on Codewars, lower numbers are more difficult)
</ol>
