# Code Challenges

This is an archive of code challenges that I have participated in on sites like Codewars.

I am in the process of uploading all of them. This is ongoing because I'm improving and reworking some of my older solutions to be more efficient.

## Navigating

The folder structure is Site -> Language -> Challenge Title.

Each challenge folder has:

1. A description file.
1. One or more solution files

The latest solution file is always `solution.(language suffix)`

## Descriptions

Description files have:

1. Challenge title
1. Link to the challenge
1. Difficulty rank (on Codewars, lower numbers are more difficult)
1. Description (this is copied from the challenge)
1. Notes (my personal notes about the challenge, explaining how I solved it)
