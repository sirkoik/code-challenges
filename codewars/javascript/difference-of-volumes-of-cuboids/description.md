# Challenge: Difference of Volumes of Cuboids

In this simple exercise, you will create a program that will take two lists of integers, `a` and `b`. Each list will consist of 3 positive integers above 0, representing the dimensions of cuboids a and b. You must find the difference of the cuboids' volumes regardless of which is bigger.

For example, if the parameters passed are `([2, 2, 3], [5, 4, 1])`, the volume of `a` is 12 and the volume of `b` is 20. Therefore, the function should return `8`.

Your function will be tested with pre-made examples as well as random ones.

If you can, try writing it in one line of code.

# Notes and Solutions

I wrote a solution for this a while ago. I tried it again recently and was able to come up with a much more simple solution that involved multiplying the parameters and then taking the absolute value.
