# Description

In this simple exercise, you will create a program that will take two lists of integers, a and b. Each list will consist of 3 positive integers above 0, representing the dimensions of cuboids a and b. You must find the difference of the cuboids' volumes regardless of which is bigger.

For example, if the parameters passed are ([2, 2, 3], [5, 4, 1]), the volume of a is 12 and the volume of b is 20. Therefore, the function should return 8.

Your function will be tested with pre-made examples as well as random ones.

If you can, try writing it in one line of code.

# Notes

I wrote a solution for this a while ago. I tried it again recently and was able to come up with a much more simple solution that involved multiplying the parameters and then taking the absolute value.

`solution.js` has my latest solution.
